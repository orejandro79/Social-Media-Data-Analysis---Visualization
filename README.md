## 📄 Project Overview
In this project, you will step into the role of an entry-level data analyst at a social media agency. The goal is to create a comprehensive report that evaluates the performance of different categories of social media posts to help clients optimize their strategies and increase their reach and engagement.

## 🌐 Project Scenario
Imagine you work for a social media marketing agency that specializes in promoting brands and products on a popular social media platform. Your team is responsible for analyzing the effectiveness of various types of posts categorized into topics like health, family, food, and more. This analysis helps clients refine their social media strategy for optimal results.

In this project, you’ll use Python to:
- Automatically extract tweets from one or more specified categories.
- Clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

The insights generated will guide the agency in delivering tweets that are timely, within budget, and highly impactful for their audience.
